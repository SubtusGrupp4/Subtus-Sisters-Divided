using UnityEngine;

public class GiveTagAttribute : PropertyAttribute
{
    // Data being sent to Drawer...


    // REASONING 

    // Since the Drawer uses existing data infrom of Taglist
    // no data is actually needed to be sent, but to use a Drawer (atleast to extent I want too, the attribute way)
    // you have to asign a porpertyAttribute, therefore we have this empty attribute.
}
